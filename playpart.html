            _[THE SAME SCENE.—THE Christmas Tree is in the corner by the piano,
            stripped of its ornaments and with burnt-down candle-ends on its
            dishevelled branches. NORA’S cloak and hat are lying on the sofa. She

            No—it is no one. Of course, no one will come today,
            Christmas Day—nor tomorrow either. But, perhaps—

            No, nothing in the letterbox; it is quite empty.

            What rubbish! of course he can’t be in earnest about it. Such a thing couldn’t happen;
            it is impossible—I have three little children.

            Thanks; put it on the table.

            I should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces.

            What an idea! It can easily be put in order—just a little patience.
